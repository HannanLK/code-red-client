Comprehensive Iterative Development Plan for Two-Player Scrabble
Phase 0: Planning & Architecture Design
Missing Requirements to Address:

Dictionary/Word Validation: No specific dictionary mentioned (TWL, SOWPODS, etc.)
Scoring System: No mention of letter values, premium squares (double/triple word/letter)
Endgame Conditions: Only timer expiry mentioned, not standard Scrabble endings
Tile Distribution: Standard Scrabble tile quantities not specified
Board Size: Assuming standard 15x15 board
Technology Stack: No specific technologies mentioned
Authentication/User Management: No mention of player accounts
Reconnection Logic: What happens if a player disconnects?
Challenge System: No mention of word challenges
Visual/Audio Feedback: No UI/UX specifications

Initial Architecture Decisions:

Backend: Node.js with Express/Socket.io or Python with FastAPI/WebSockets
Frontend: React/Vue.js with Canvas or SVG for board rendering
Database: Redis for game state, PostgreSQL for user data
Dictionary: Use ENABLE or TWL dictionary file


Stage 1: Core Game & User Interface
Iteration 1.1: Server Foundation

Set up project structure and version control
Initialize server with WebSocket support
Create basic client-server connection test
Implement lobby system with queue management
Create game instance manager for concurrent games

Iteration 1.2: Game State Management

Define data structures:

Board (15x15 grid with premium squares)
Tile bag (100 tiles with proper distribution)
Player state (rack, score, turn status)
Game state (current turn, move history)


Implement game initialization:

Random starting player selection
Initial tile distribution (7 tiles per player)
Board setup with premium squares



Iteration 1.3: Core Game Rules Engine

Implement tile placement validation:

First move center star requirement
Connected word validation
Single line (horizontal/vertical) validation


Create dictionary lookup system
Implement scoring calculator:

Letter values
Premium square multipliers
Cross-word scoring


Implement move validation pipeline

Iteration 1.4: Client UI Foundation

Create board rendering system:

15x15 grid display
Premium square visualization
Placed tiles display


Implement tile rack UI:

Display player's tiles
Drag-and-drop functionality
Shuffle button


Create score display and turn indicator

Iteration 1.5: User Interaction System

Implement click-to-start placement:

Square selection
Direction toggle on re-click
Visual direction indicator


Keyboard input handling:

Letter placement along path
Shift+letter for blank tiles
Auto-skip occupied squares


Move submission (Enter key)
Pass turn confirmation dialog

Iteration 1.6: Tile Exchange System

Create exchange dialog UI
Implement tile selection interface
Server-side exchange logic
Update tile bag after exchange

Iteration 1.7: Client-Side Validations

Implement warning system for:

Invalid turn attempts
Invalid tile placement
Word off board
Missing starting point


Create non-intrusive warning UI component


Stage 2: Secure Game Clock
Iteration 2.1: Server Timer Implementation

Create server-side timer class
Implement 10-minute per player allocation
Timer pause/resume for turn changes
Automatic game end on timer expiry

Iteration 2.2: Client Timer Synchronization

Create timer display component
Implement WebSocket timer updates
Add visual urgency indicators (color changes)
Handle timer synchronization on reconnection


Stage 3: Basic Bot Player
Iteration 3.1: Bot Infrastructure

Create bot player class
Implement bot lobby presence
Bot game instance management
Bot-human matchmaking logic

Iteration 3.2: Valid Move Generator

Implement board scanning for anchor squares
Create valid placement finder
Basic word generation from rack
Random valid move selection
30-second timeout enforcement


Stage 4: Advanced Bot
Iteration 4.1: Efficient Word Generation

Implement DAWG/Trie data structure
Create efficient word lookup
Implement cross-check system
Generate all possible moves

Iteration 4.2: Move Evaluation System

Implement scoring calculator for all moves
Create evaluation heuristics:

Immediate score
Rack leave quality
Board position value
Vowel/consonant balance



Iteration 4.3: Strategic Enhancements

Implement defensive play:

Block premium squares
Avoid setting up opponent


Offensive strategies:

Setup for future bingos
Premium square targeting


Endgame strategy adjustments

Iteration 4.4: Look-ahead Implementation

Create minimax framework
Implement 2-3 move look-ahead
Pruning strategies for performance
Time management within 30 seconds


Additional Recommended Iterations
Stage 5: Polish & Enhancement

Reconnection System: Handle disconnections gracefully
Spectator Mode: Allow game observation
Game History: Move replay system
Statistics: Track player performance
Sound Effects: Tile placement, timer warnings
Animations: Smooth tile movements
Mobile Responsiveness: Touch controls

Stage 6: Production Readiness

Authentication System: User accounts and sessions
Persistent Storage: Save incomplete games
Error Handling: Comprehensive error recovery
Performance Optimization: Load testing
Security: Input validation, rate limiting
Deployment: CI/CD pipeline setup


Testing Strategy Throughout
For Each Stage:

Unit Tests: Game logic, validation rules
Integration Tests: Client-server communication
E2E Tests: Complete game flows
Performance Tests: Concurrent game handling
Bot Testing: Move validity and timing

Key Milestones

Milestone 1: Two humans can complete a basic game
Milestone 2: Timer system prevents cheating
Milestone 3: Bot provides single-player option
Milestone 4: Bot provides challenging gameplay
Milestone 5: Production-ready with full features
